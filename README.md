=============

This is my portfolio of some of my projects I worked on the last five years.
It includes professional websites and small side projects.

It currently just uses a static mock file, but I am going to include a small GraphQL.

How to run this project
-------------------------

```bash
yarn # or npm install -- install dependencies
yarn start # or npm start -- start project
```
